SECURITY MEASURES

* All form fields are checked for newlines or null bytes followed by email commands.
* HTTP Referrer is required, and checked against an array of allowed referrers. 
* To and From emails are validated
* Emails may only be sent to the recipient defined in the script
* If all of these checks pass, the contents of the email submitted to Akismet to verify it's not spam.

EXAMPLE FORM:

<form action='contact.php' method='POST'>
  <input type='hidden' class='hidden' name='redirect' value='http://test.com/'>
  <label for='name'>Name</label>
  <input class='text' maxlength='40' type='text' size='18' name='name' value='Name' />
  <!-- spam bait - if the bcc field contains anything, this email is rejected -->
  <!--<label for='bcc'>Bcc</label>-->
  <!--<input class='text' maxlength='40' type='text' size='18' name='bcc' value='' />-->
  <label for='email'>Email</label>
  <input class='text' maxlength='80' type='text' size='18' name='email' value='' />
  <label for='comments'>Message</label>
  <textarea name='comments' cols='15' rows='4' type='text'></textarea>
  <input type='submit' value='Send'>
  <!-- any additional fields will be include in the email, but won't be checked for spam by Akismet -->
</form>

REQUIRED PARAMETERS:

* email - valid email that will be the from address. the contents of this parameter will be sent to Akismet for spam checking

* bcc - THIS FIELD IS REQUIRED TO BE BLANK. This is designed to bait spammers. I've found that spammers generally submit all contact form fields, even if commented out. (http://isc.sans.org/diary.php?storyid=1836)

OPTIONAL PARAMETERS:

* redirect - full URL (with http://) that the script will redirect to on success.

* name - the contents of this parameter will be sent to Akismet for spam checking

* comments - the contents of this parameter will be sent to Akismet for spam checking

All other parameters will be included in the email, but will not be checked by Akismet.
